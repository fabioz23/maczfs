# Project History #

Years ago, Apple began the visionary and ambitious undertaking of porting ZFS to Mac OS.  The company distributed ZFS as a read-only kernel extension in Mac OS 10.5 and later as a fully functional suite in the developer beta builds of Mac OS 10.6.  Apple hosted the project at the now defunct _http://zfs.macosforge.org/_; the now defunct original mailing list [is now mirrored at Nabble](http://mac-os-x-zfs-discuss.19757.n3.nabble.com/).  After a lengthy hiatus from the public eye prior to the final release of Mac OS 10.6, the company unceremoniously withdrew their involvement from the ZFS community both internally and publicly, by suddenly deleting all traces of ZFS from their web sites and almost all traces of ZFS from Mac OS.

Possible explanations for this action involve a failure to achieve a private licensing agreement between Apple and Sun over the ZFS source code.  This was severely exacerbated by overarching legal aggression from Net App toward Sun, and hence potentially toward Sun's customers such as Apple.

Forever grateful to Sun, to Apple, and to all of their brilliantly visionary engineers for the generous head start, the community fearlessly resumed the project's development.  The community reacted immediately to the disorienting setback by mirroring all historical resources, by opening this project page, and by starting various personal source code forks.  Development has ensued in the years since.

The summary result of all of these efforts made by Sun, Apple, and the MacZFS community is the drastic advancement of the state of the art of storage technology on Mac OS.

Aside from MacZFS, there is another port of ZFS to Mac OS which was done by [Ten's Complement](TensComplement.md) and [GreenBytes](http://www.getgreenbytes.com/blog/bid/80758/GreenBytes-Welcomes-ZEVO-and-Don-Brady), who has altered their original commitment to free software and now instead offers to customers, a proprietary subset of ZFS functionality.
